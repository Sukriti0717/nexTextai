This project aims to create an advanced writing assistant which is designed to enhance, streamline and simplify the writing process by leveraging the cutting-edge technologies in generative AI and machine learning. This advanced writing assistant tool provides users with intelligent text completion, contextual phrase suggestions, and robust error detection and correction. In addition, cognitive (working memory) resources are spent on low-level writing tasks (word production, translation) at the expense of time being allocated to higher-level writing tasks such as organization and revision.
